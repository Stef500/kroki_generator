# M4 Extensions Diagrammes - Task Completion

## Objective Complete ✅
Successfully implemented M4 Extensions diagrammes (1.5h) as requested, adding support for 6 additional diagram types beyond the original 3 (Mermaid, PlantUML, Graphviz).

## New Diagram Types Added
**Priority Types (as specified):**
- ✅ **BlockDiag**: Block diagram format with styling support
- ✅ **Excalidraw**: Hand-drawn style diagrams with JSON format

**Additional Types:**
- ✅ **Ditaa**: ASCII art diagrams 
- ✅ **SeqDiag**: Sequence diagrams in blockdiag family
- ✅ **ActDiag**: Activity diagrams in blockdiag family  
- ✅ **BPMN**: Business Process Model and Notation

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`src/kroki_client.py`)
- Extended `valid_types` list from 3 to 9 supported types
- Added `_preprocess_blockdiag_family()` method with styling support
- Added `_preprocess_ditaa()` method (pass-through)
- Updated docstring to reflect new supported types
- No breaking changes - fully backward compatible

### Frontend Changes (`templates/index.html`)
- Updated dropdown with 6 new diagram type options
- Added examples for BlockDiag, Excalidraw, and Ditaa
- Maintained existing UI structure and functionality
- All new types integrate seamlessly with existing theme/format options

### Testing (`tests/`)
- Added validation tests for all new diagram types
- Added preprocessing tests for blockdiag family
- Added integration tests in routes for all new types
- Fixed syntax issues and linting compliance
- Maintained 85% test coverage

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md feature description
- Added examples for priority diagram types (BlockDiag, Excalidraw, Ditaa, SeqDiag)
- Updated API examples with BlockDiag curl command
- Updated TASKS.md to mark M4 Extensions as completed

## Quality Standards Maintained
- ✅ All unit tests passing (49/49)
- ✅ Ruff linting compliance (All checks passed!)
- ✅ 85% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Type hints and docstrings complete
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Implementation
The extension leverages Kroki's native support for these diagram types. The preprocessing functions add styling defaults for blockdiag family diagrams while preserving the original functionality for types that don't need preprocessing (excalidraw, ditaa, bpmn).

## Production Ready
The implementation is immediately deployable:
- Backward compatible with existing diagrams
- Robust error handling for new types
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation updated for users
