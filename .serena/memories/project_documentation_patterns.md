# Project Documentation Improvement Patterns

## Pattern: Documentation Coherence Analysis
Successfully applied systematic approach to analyze and improve project documentation:

### Analysis Framework Applied
1. **Cross-document coherence** checking (PRD ↔ PLANNING ↔ TASKS)
2. **Granularity enhancement** with detailed time estimates
3. **Dependency mapping** with explicit task relationships
4. **Scope clarification** between MVP and extended features

### Specific Improvements Made
- **TASKS.md**: Added hour-level estimates, dependency tracking, sub-task organization
- **PRD.md**: Separated MVP (3 diagram types) from Post-MVP extensions
- **PLANNING.md**: Enhanced with ASCII architecture diagrams, security considerations

### Key Insights
- Large feature lists in PRD create implementation ambiguity
- Task estimation benefits from hour-level granularity vs day-level
- Architecture diagrams (even ASCII) significantly improve understanding
- Dependency mapping prevents implementation bottlenecks

### Reusable Patterns
1. **MVP Separation**: Clearly distinguish core features from extensions
2. **Time Boxing**: Prefer hour estimates for tasks <1 day
3. **Visual Architecture**: Include flow diagrams even in text format
4. **Security Planning**: Address input validation, limits, monitoring upfront

## Application Template
For future documentation reviews:
1. Check tri-document alignment (requirements → architecture → tasks)
2. Verify granularity appropriateness (hours vs days vs weeks)
3. Map dependencies explicitly
4. Separate MVP from nice-to-have features
5. Include security and performance considerations
