# Session: Create Graph Project Setup

## Session Summary
Successfully completed project initialization and documentation improvement for create_graph Python project focused on Kroki diagram generation.

## Key Achievements
1. **Project Activation**: Activated Serena MCP for create_graph project at `/Users/stef/PycharmProjects/create_graph`
2. **CLAUDE.md Creation**: Created comprehensive guidance file for future Claude instances with:
   - Project structure explanation (src/, pyproject.toml)
   - Development commands and workflow
   - Python 3.12+ project conventions
3. **Git Setup**: Created proper .gitignore for Python project, removed .idea files from staging
4. **Documentation Enhancement**: Improved project planning documents with detailed analysis

## Project Structure Understanding
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Structure**: Modern Python packaging (src/, pyproject.toml)
- **Tools**: Flask-based Kroki diagram generator
- **Architecture**: Web UI + API for diagram generation via Kroki service

## Files Modified/Created
- `CLAUDE.md`: New comprehensive project guide
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python gitignore with IDE exclusions
- `TASKS.md`: Enhanced with detailed estimations and dependencies
- `PRD.md`: Improved coherence between MVP and extended features
- `PLANNING.md`: Enriched with detailed architecture diagrams and security considerations

## Technical Decisions
- Removed .idea files from git tracking (proper IDE hygiene)
- Established modern Python project structure conventions
- Created clear documentation hierarchy: PRD → PLANNING → TASKS

## Next Session Preparation
Project is now properly configured for development work with:
- Clear architectural understanding
- Detailed task breakdown with dependencies
- Proper development workflow documentation
- Git hygiene established
