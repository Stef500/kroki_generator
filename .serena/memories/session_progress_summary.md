# Session Progress Summary - M3 Implementation

## Session Objectives
- Complete M3 "Qualité & Tests" milestone (4h détaillé)
- Achieve ≥80% test coverage 
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Set up quality gates and pre-commit hooks

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Assessment** (10 min):
   - Analyzed existing test coverage (75%)
   - Identified missing test files and coverage gaps

2. **Test Fixes** (20 min):
   - Fixed failing health route test (handles 503 degraded status)
   - Fixed error handling test (updated to match detailed error messages)
   - Added pytest markers configuration

3. **Coverage Enhancement** (30 min):
   - Added `tests/test_main.py` for Flask application factory
   - Added `tests/test_config.py` for configuration management  
   - Enhanced `tests/test_kroki_client.py` with additional scenarios
   - Achieved 85% coverage (exceeding 80% target)

4. **Quality Infrastructure** (30 min):
   - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with comprehensive hooks
   - Implemented `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with multi-job pipeline
   - Configured pytest markers for integration tests

5. **Documentation & Validation** (10 min):
   - Updated `TASKS.md` with completion status
   - Validated all tests passing with proper coverage
   - Created memory documentation for future reference

## Technical Challenges Resolved
- **Config Testing**: Handled class-level attribute evaluation vs instance testing
- **Integration Tests**: Configured Docker service waiting and error tolerance
- **Coverage Gaps**: Identified untested code paths in error handling and main execution
- **CI Pipeline**: Balanced comprehensive testing with execution efficiency

## Quality Metrics Achieved
- **Test Coverage**: 85% (target: ≥80%)
- **Test Count**: 41 tests passing
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit + CI pipeline operational
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive test strategy documented

## Session Output Files
- New: `tests/test_main.py`, `tests/test_config.py`
- New: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` 
- Modified: `tests/test_routes.py`, `tests/test_kroki_client.py`
- Updated: `TASKS.md`, `pyproject.toml` (pytest config)

## Project State
- M3 milestone: ✅ COMPLETED
- Next available: M4 (Extras) - optional extensions
- Production readiness: ✅ Ready with full CI/CD pipeline
- Quality assurance: ✅ Automated testing and linting operational
